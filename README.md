# pricetracker
Super simple Amazon price tracker. Only works for one product provided a link. Modifications in the code also need to be made to reflect the price(ex: indices on price variable for proper float conversion). 
Built following a youtube tutorial, with a few modifications as listed above. My first "real" automation project, I may be updating this to include several products of a similar niche or brand, etc. as I gain more 
experience with automation and Python.
